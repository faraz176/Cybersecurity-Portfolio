## Shuaib Ahmed Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hello! I'm a **CCNA-certified Network Engineer** currently transitioning into the field of cybersecurity. This repository serves as a living document of my hands-on experience with various security tools and concepts through platforms like TryHackMe, Blue Team Labs Online, and personal projects.

My goal is to apply my deep understanding of networking to a defensive security role as a **SOC Analyst** or **Network Security Engineer**.
